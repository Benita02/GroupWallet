**Tagline:** Where shared money becomes simple.

## What GroupWallet does
GroupWallet is a group finance app that helps friends, coursemates, couples, housemates, and even cooperatives collect, track, and manage shared money — without the stress. It automates contributions, shows who paid, records receipts, and handles lending with automated follow-ups so no one has to awkwardly chase money.


## Why it matters
Shared finances cause conflicts and erode trust when tracking is manual and opaque. GroupWallet replaces messy chats and spreadsheets with a transparent, tamper-resistant ledger and automated workflows that protect relationships.

## Who it’s for
- University groups and class treasurers  
- Housemates and roommates  
- Small community groups, cooperatives, and informal savings circles

## Key features
- Group wallets with role-based members (treasurer, member)  
- Real-time contribution tracking: see who has/hasn't paid  
- Expense logging with photo receipts and comments  
- 51% approval required for withdrawals (prevents unilateral spending)  
- In-app lending: send loans inside the app and set repayment terms  
- Automated loan follow-ups: email, SMS, WhatsApp, and call escalation if repayment is overdue  
- Mobile-first UI with offline resilience for low-connectivity scenarios

## Tech highlights (short)
- Mobile-first frontend (React Native or Next.js mobile web)  
- Backend API (Node.js/Express or Django)  
- PostgreSQL for relational data and ledger integrity  
- Push notifications + Twilio for SMS & calls + WhatsApp API for escalations  
- Payment rails via local PSPs (e.g., Paystack, Flutterwave) or bank transfer integrations
